# We can see this model is not going to get us very far. There are several known approaches for predicting recommended
# items or ratings, including using PCA, SVD, or one of the numerous libraries available such as recommenderlab.
#
# The real challenge here is not in finding a workable algorithm - even RandomForest will work quite well. The challenge 
# we have is with the dataset size itself. If this project used the 1M MovieLens set it would be fairly easy to use
# a plug-in approach using recommenderlab, however, as noted by other students, the large matrices required to be generated
# for the 10M dataset simply does not fit into the RAM available. I've tried this on Azure with 160GB allocated and all the 
# standard approaches simply failed. I could aim for 50% accuracy but would consider that a failure, really. So for this 
# project and dataset size we need to find an algorithm that allows us to split the dataset into trainable chunks, when if
# finally combined, fits into 32GB + swap space at least. I understand that many students may not have access to machines 
# with 32GB of RAM but unfortunately my score depends on accuracy. So if you cannot run this code, I am happy to demo.

# Slope One implementation
#
# Slope One was introduced by Daniel Lemire and Anna Maclachlan in their paper 
# â€˜Slope One Predictors for Online Rating-Based Collaborative Filteringâ€™. This algorithm is one of the simplest ways to 
# perform collaborative filtering based on itemsâ€™ similarity. This makes it very easy to implement and use, and accuracy of
# this algorithm equals the accuracy of more complicated and resource-intensive algorithms.
#
# The Slope One method operates with average differences of ratings between each item and makes predictions based on their 
# weighted value. 
#
# It is pretty fast, but for a huge dataset it needs a lot of RAM. For that reason we break the training set into 20
# smaller sets for training, and merge that into a single model at the end. This process takes around 2 hours on a desktop 
# but requires at least 32GB of ram and 12GB of extra swap space. Slope One was chosen as it is an algorithm that can be easily
# split into sets for training and re-combined without loss of accuracy.
